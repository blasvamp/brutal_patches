This application is a Ruby on Rails version of Brady Jacobsen's
MicroBrute Patch Configurator.  The original version can be found at
http://bradyjacobsen.com/microbrute.

This version seeks to add some additional functionality such as
browsing, searching, marking patches as 'favorites', and ranking.
